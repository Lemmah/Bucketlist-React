# bucketlist-react

The innovative bucketlist app is an application that allows users  to record and share things they want to achieve or experience before reaching a certain age meeting the needs of keeping track of their dreams and goals. This is the *frontend* made using react to consume the Bucketlist-API written in Flask for enabling users to perform crud operations on bucketlists and items with user persistence.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `https://github.com/Lemmah/bucketlist-react.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd bucketlist-react`
- Install project requirements using npm pip. But wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Nodejs 7 and above
- Npm, usually comes with Node

Just type:
```
node -v
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to 7.*, you might have some issues (we live in a changing world!) but you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

Now, you have nodejs and `npm -v` has good news about it's version. Lets set up the project environment.(remember we're still in the app directory)

This app was made using `create-react-app` so, it's easy stuff:

1. Install Required Node Modules by running:
```
npm install
```

You might need to get our API locally but by default it runs on heroku. If you want to clone it as well, get it [here](https://github.com/Lemmah/Bucketlist-API.git)
This is enough to get you started.

2. You can now run the application using:
```
npm start
```


## Running the tests

Easy, just:
`npm test`
